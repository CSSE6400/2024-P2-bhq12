# GETTING STARTED

You should have a recent python version installed (specifically python 3.10 or higher)

To install the python dependencies locally:

- Make sure you have the poetry dependency manager installed (https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
- Run the following command in the base directory to install the dependency packages: 
`
poetry install
`

- After installing the packages, you can run the API locally by running this script in the base directory:

`
sh ./run_todo_api.sh
`
